# Online-ecommerce CRUD

In this repository, you will find links to both a frontend and a backend server. The expected workflow is to clone the backend repository and use the provided link to Vercel, or alternatively, use the frontend client to interact with the backend you’ve cloned from GitHub. Once cloned, you will need to install the necessary dependencies from the requirements.txt file, using a virtual environment either created on your local machine or generated from scratch (it is recommended to create a new one).

Backend: https://github.com/JohnCard/Backend---codeandote

Frontend: online-ecommerce-ten.vercel.app

No database setup is required, nor do you need to create a new Django instance. The backend server already comes pre-configured with its own external database, so you won’t need to worry about the data displayed on the frontend client/server.
