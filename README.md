# Online-ecommerce CRUD

In this repository, you will find links to both a frontend and a backend server. The expected workflow is to clone the backend repository and use the provided link to Vercel, or alternatively, use the frontend client to interact with the backend you’ve cloned from GitHub. Once cloned, you will need to install the necessary dependencies from the requirements.txt file, using a virtual environment either created on your local machine or generated from scratch (it is recommended to create a new one).

Backend: https://github.com/JohnCard/Backend---codeandote

Frontend: online-ecommerce-ten.vercel.app

No database setup is required, nor do you need to create a new Django instance. The backend server already comes pre-configured with its own external database, so you won’t need to worry about the data displayed on the frontend client/server.

However, it is important to note that in order to enable the Aiven database, from which the backend server retrieves all the data required to operate, you will need to contact the server’s creator (+52 246-239-2759) so the database can be activated. Otherwise, if the Aiven database is not enabled, no commands will work and the project will not function, even if it has been correctly cloned from GitHub (backend django server).
